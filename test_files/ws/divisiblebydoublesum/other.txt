Pseudocode:

Integer sum = 0
Integer input = STDIN as integer
Integer n = input
Start LOOP:
  If(n == 0):
    Jump to Label DONE
  Integer t = n modulo-10
  sum = sum + t
  n = n integer-divided by 10
  Go to next iteration of LOOP

DONE:
  sum = sum * 2
  Integer result = input % sum
  Print result as integer to STDOUT
